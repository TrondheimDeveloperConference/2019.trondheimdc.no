                    All attendees, speakers, partners, staff and volunteers at our conference are required to
                    follow the code of conduct.
                </p>

                <p>
                    TDC strives to be an enjoyable and welcoming conference for all attendees,
                    regardless of their background, abilities or appearance. We do not tolerate harassment of our
                    participants or staff in any form. Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, age,
                    sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion (or lack thereof),
                    deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against
                    reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, unwanted physical contact, and
                    unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual imagery in public spaces is inappropriate for TDC, especially
                    in talks and workshops but also at social events, Twitter and other online media.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Partners are also subject to this policy. In particular, partners should not use sexualised
                    images,
                    activities, or other material, use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
                    sexualised environment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Participants, speakers or partners asked to stop any harassing or inappropriate behavior are
                    expected to comply immediately.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers will confer with the offended
                    party and take any action they deem appropriate, from warning the offender to expulsion from
                    the conference with no refund.
                </p>

                <p>The TDC staff cannot be everywhere all the time. If you are being harassed, notice that someone
                    else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, say something if you feel safe speaking up,
                    and please contact an organizer immediately. Even if the situation has already been handled,
                    this will help us keep an eye out for further problems.
                    You can also reach Save Asmervik at +47 99 37 54 46.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will do our best to help participants feel comfortable again after an incident.
                    We can contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise
                    assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. Know that
                    we value your attendance over that of the harasser regardless of their speaker status or
                    community
                    standing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Participants are required to follow these rules at all conference-related events
                    â€“ official or otherwise.
