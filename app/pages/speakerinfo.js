                    By now, you probably have all the essentials in place – travel arrangements if you are coming from out of town, and a place to stay. If not, it’s probably a good idea to get this fixed.

                    The conference is, as always, located at <a href={spektrum}>Oslo Spektrum</a>. All sessions will take place here. For those of you who are new to Oslo – this is more or less in the heart of the city (no more than a five minute walk from the main street).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a speaker, you have access to the <b>Speakers Lounge</b> in addition to the rest of Oslo Spektrum. This is a good place to relax or look over your presentation a few times before you’re up.

                        To ensure that everything goes as smooth as possible, everyone is asked to arrive at their designated presentation room <b>20 minutes</b> before the start of the session. In practice, this means that you should show up at the end of the session just before yours. Each room has a technician who can help you with connecting your laptop to the projector, and also fit you with a microphone. Testing your laptop on the projector is especially important if you have a lightning talk – there won’t be time for projector issues during these sessions.

                        If you are holding a workshop the day before the conference (Tuesday, September 12th), we will meet you at the entrance and guide you to the workshop rooms. You should still meet <b>20 minutes</b> before the start of your workshop to get set up.
