                    <p>
                        Over the last decade JavaZone has grown to become one of the most important Java events in Europe! You can see for yourself – 1174 videos from previous years talks are available for free at <a href='https://vimeo.com/javazone'>Vimeo</a>, and the <a href='https://2017.javazone.no/program'>full program from JavaZone 2017</a> is also available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can brag as much as we want, but JavaZone would be nothing without all the great speakers! That's why we need your help to make sure that JavaZone 2018 will be at least as awesome as the earlier events. If you think you have something interesting to share, please submit your talk or workshop at the latest on April 8th 2018.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaZone is committed to diversity, and we are especially interested in quality submissions from groups that are under-represented in tech.

	                        JavaZone is a conference for developers and technical architects, with an emphasis on technical talks. However, we are open to talks about other areas, including methodology, project management, and other topics related to programming.

                            Despite our conference's name, we do not limit our content to Java technology. We will consider all talks based on their relevance to developers and technical architects. We do however set a focus on technology surrounding the JVM when selecting talks.

                    <p>
                        JavaZone is proud to be an independent and community-driven conference. It is organized by volunteers from javaBin (the Norwegian Java User Group) and is run as a non-profit organisation. This means that we have three important principles for selecting talks:
                    </p>
                    <ul className='speakers__list'>
                        <li className='speakers__principle'>We do not sell speaker slots.</li>
                        <li className='speakers__principle'>We do not accept sales pitches masked as presentations</li>
                        <li className='speakers__principle'>We do not differentiate between speakers from partners and independent speakers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If your talk adheres to these very important principles, you are more than welcome to submit it to our Call for Speakers!
