                        Multiple tickets can be bought at the same time. You can then assign the tickets to the participants via email. Just use our regular webshop and specify the number of tickets you require when buying.

                        Paying by invoice can be accommodated if required, but please consider buying the tickets using the webshop if you can. You’ll get a receipt which can be used for reimbursements even when paying with credit card.

                    <P>
                        If you need a refund on your ticket, send an email with your request to <a href="mailto:javazone@java.no">javazone@java.no</a>.
                        We'll refund the full ticket price minus a small processing fee (to cover credit card fees or invoice fees) for requests submitted before August 1st.
                        Refund requests received after August 1st will only be accepted if javaBin are able to resell the tickets.
                        For tickets bought in bulk (applies to both partner tickets and large regular orders), a maximum of 5 tickets can be refunded under this policy.

                        JavaZone is organized for and by the community. Your ticket includes a membership to javaBin, giving you access to all the javaBin community events and voting rights for a full year after buying the ticket.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Previously we used to sell tickets and memberships separately, but you saved a total of 500 NOK by buying both. It seemed silly to force you through two separate web shops to collect this discount, so we combined the two and thereby made the tickets cheaper for everyone. If you still would like to pay extra as before, let us know! ;-)

                        We'll release more information about the conference before the summer, and the detailed program with information about all the talks will be ready in July. Until then, have a look at the video on top and <a href="http://2016.javazone.no">the 2016 website</a> to get a feel for how awesome JavaZone is!

                        Don't wait too long buying your ticket though – last year we completely sold out all of the 3.000 tickets, and we expect a decent amout of interest this year as well.
