                    JavaZone – the biggest European community-driven conference for modern developers will be 17
                    years old in 2018! Don’t miss out on two days of inspiring tech talks,
                    a day of hands-on sessions, mingling, and a great party!
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaZone is organized by <a href="https://java.no">javaBin</a>, the Norwegian Java User Group. Our goal is to organize a community-driven conference for Java developers where they can learn new things, share knowledge, and socialize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have been organizing JavaZone since 2001 and have been excited to watch the event grow bigger and better every year. In 2017 we hosted over 3100 participants and almost 200 speakers across 7 parallel tracks over the course of two days. In addition, we also offered a selection of 9 workshops held on the day before the conference started.

                    We would not be what we are today without YOU! Thank you for your support and contributions over the years. Don’t procrastinate! Join your fellow Java developers at JavaZone on September 12th-13th, 2018!
