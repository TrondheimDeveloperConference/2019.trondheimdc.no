                        We'll release more information about the conference before the summer,
                        and the detailed program with information about all the talks will be ready in September.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Don't wait too long buying your ticket though â€“ last year all of the tickets were sold,
                        and we had waiting lists. We expect a decent amout of interest this year as well.
