                        We seem to somehow have lost the page you are looking for.
                        If you are a technical person, this is what you might usually
                        refer to as a classical 404 response code. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are of course
                        using advanced technology to keep things like these from
                        happening, but every now and then technology (or we...) fails. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have a lot of time on your hands (or are just really kind),
                        we would really appreciate it if you <a href='mailto:javazone@java.no'>
                        tell us about it</a>.
                    </p>
